## Wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater in Bratislava, Slovakia

The statistics for Bratislava shows the correlation between the positive PCR tests, deaths caused by COVID-19 and detected virus particles from wastewater (our wastewater model) – figures 01, 02, 03.



fig\_01

Reported numbers of positive PCR tests and reported numbers of death cases vs wastewater viral particles data model in Bratislava. The monitored time period was from September 2020 to March 2021.



fig\_02

Reported numbers of positive PCR tests with the time lag of 2 weeks vs double square root wastewater model estimation of positive PCR tests in Bratislava (R^2=83.78%, p-value<0.0001). The monitored time period was from September 2020 to March 2021.



fig\_03

Reported numbers of death cases with the time lag of 4 weeks vs square root-Y logarithmic-X wastewater model estimation of death cases in Bratislava (R^2=83.21%, p-value<0.0001). The monitored time period was from September 2020 to March 2021.
