**The scale of student challenges in EMI education (validated version**)

**Sources of knowledge**

The following scale items are taken, with permission, from the work of Stephen Evans, who must be credited in any future work that uses or adapts this instrument. Credit can be cited to either of the following published pieces of work:

* Evans, S., & Green, C. (2007). Why EAP is necessary: A survey of Hong Kong tertiary students. *Journal of English for Academic Purposes*, *6*(1), 3-17. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeap.2006.11.005>

**Scale validation**

The scale in its current 7-point Likert Scale format was used in the following study, and validated via Confirmatory Factor Analysis:

* Kamasak, R., Sahan, K., & Rose, H. (2021). Academic language-related challenges at an English-medium university. *Journal of English for Academic Purposes*, 49: 100945. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeap.2020.100945> (Appendix A)

**Use in other research**

The full 45-item scale (Appendix B) has also been used in the following published research:

* Rose, H., McKinley, J., Xu, X. and Zhou, S. (2020). *Investigating policy and implementation of English medium instruction in higher education institutions in China*. London: British Council. <https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/investigating-policy-implementation-english-medium-instruction-higher-education-0>
* Aizawa, I. & Rose, H. (2020). High school to university transitional challenges in English Medium Instruction in Japan. *System*. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.system.2020.102390> [Original 5-point Likert Scale version used]
* Aizawa, I. & Rose, H. (2019). An analysis of Japan's English as medium of instruction initiatives within higher education: the gap between meso-level policy and micro-level practice. *Higher Education*, 77(6): 1125-1142. <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-018-0323-5> [Original 5-point Likert Scale version used]

The scale has also been validated in a Japanese context using confirmatory factor analysis in the following study:

* Aizawa, I., Rose, H., Thompson, G. & Curle, S. (2020). Beyond the threshold: Exploring English language proficiency, linguistic challenges, and academic language skills of Japanese students in an English Medium Instruction programme. *Language Teaching Research,* *https://doi.org/10.1177/1362168820965510*

# APPENDIX A: The EMI Challenges Scale

**Adapted from:** Evans, S., & Morrison, B. (2011). Meeting the challenges of English-medium higher education: The first-year experience in Hong Kong. *English for Specific Purposes*, *30*(3), 198-208. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esp.2011.01.001>

**Validated in:** Kamasak, R., Sahan, K., & Rose, H. (2021). Academic language-related challenges at an English-medium university. Journal of English for Academic Purposes, 49: 100945. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeap.2020.100945>

**Use:** The scale can be used in its entirety to capture challenges across all four skills, or researchers may wish to only use the items associated with each of the four skills (writing, reading, speaking, or listening). Research has shown each academic skill to constitute its own factor, and each factor to have very high reliability. Mean scores for each of the four skills can, therefore, be used for analysis in research.

**Scale:** Students respond via a seven-point Likert scale with answers ranging from 1 (very difficult) to 7 (very easy).

| Very |  | somewhat |  | somewhat |  | Very |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| diﬃcult | diﬃcult | diﬃcult | Neither | easy | easy | easy |
