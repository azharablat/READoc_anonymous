# ABSTRACT

Since the civil strife in 1991, numerous peace initiatives have been made in attempts to stabilize Somalia. These initiatives faced various challenges; their success will be limited. However, with the advent of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) in 2007, the security landscape has changed significantly; the foundations for restoring peace in the country have progressively improved. This study investigated three objectives: first, to determine the role of AMISOM in fighting terrorism in Somalia. Second, to identify the role of AMISOM in preventing violence in Somalia; and third, to analyze the role of AMISOM in promoting peace in Somalia. The study will guide the following research questions (1) what is the role of AMISOM in fighting terrorism in Somalia, (2) what is the role of AMISOM in preventing violence in Somalia, (3) what is the role of AMISOM in promoting peace in Somalia.

The study will be conducted through descriptive design. The researcher used this approach to describe and identify the role of AMISOM in bringing peace and stability in Mogadishu, Somalia. Using information from the questionnaire, the sample size will be 44 respondents only. The sample size will be determined by using Slovens formula for sample size determination, the data collected will be analyze using a questionnaire and SPSS (version 20), and a spreadsheet excels. This study recommends it is critical that AMISOM initiatives should be sustained if it is to effectively deliver on its mandate; in line with its Strategic Concept, the Police component of AMISOM should continue to build on its Formed Police Units (FPUs) to be more left public order management and Together with the Somali National Security Forces and eventually AMISOM should not relent in its drive to liberate areas still occupied by al-Shabab.

**Background of the study**

Peacekeeping; comprises the coordinated presence of military, police, and civilian personnel responsible for various tasks such as humanitarian assistance, policing, human rights and electoral monitoring, social and economic restoration, and reconstruction. Although it is an activity undertaken by many different actors, peacekeeping; history and development is intimately tied to the UN. Indeed, it is often seen as synonymous with UN operations “Peacekeeping; in all its facades, reflects a desire to limit the scourge of war. Nonetheless, given the many different conceptions concerning the nature and causes of violent conflict and variable levels of political ways to address these matters, the debate about what peacekeeping is for and what strategies should be adopted continues to rage. (Amadi, 2014)

Peacekeeping; cuts to the core of many concerns which lie at the heart of our modern society and purportedly matter a great deal to the world significant powers peace and security, justice, state sovereignty and political independence, socio-economic development, and human rights, and is therefore somewhat debated. An Indian Army, while taking part in a peacekeeping; operation, notes, in spite of several efforts, the term. Peacekeeping; has not been formally defined. This lack of clear definition provides a measure of elasticity that serves political and operational purposes. But there are corresponding disadvantages in that the term can be slackly used and vaguely understood. (Amadi, 2014)

### Problem statement

Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shahab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group captured Baidoa and some parts of Mogadishu. In January 2009, the Ethiopian troops withdrew from the country, leaving behind the under - equipped African Union (AU) peacekeeping; force as the only protector for the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and currently the Federal Government of Somalia.

In February 2012, al-Shabaab leaders quarreled with their mentor, Al-Qaeda, over its modus operandi, a quarrel that saw a reduction of support by al-Qaeda. Therefore Al-Shabaab quickly lost some of the ground it previously held. Al-Shabaab is an offshoot of the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) that splintered into several more minor factions after its defeat in 2006 by the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and its Ethiopian military allies. Al-Shabaab considers itself as waging jihad against the enemies of Islam.

**Objectives of the study**

#### General objective

To identify the role of AMISOM in bringing peace and stability in Mogadishu, Somalia.

#### Specific objectives

1. To determine the role of AMISOM in fighting terrorism in Somalia.
2. To identify the role of AMISOM in preventing violence in Somalia.

**METHODOLOGY**

### Data analysis

Data is analyzed using a statistical package for social science-SPSS. Descriptive analysis is used, and then frequency tables and charts are employed in order to present study results. In this study, the Researcher; employed Mean to Analyze the Results of the Questionnaire using a Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). SPSS is a computer program for survey authoring, data mining and statistical analysis.

The researcher will use this program because it is a convenient and simple tool that is available for the researcher;

### Conclusion

This study desired to determine the role of AMISOM in bringing peace and stability in Somalia, to find out the extent or degree of the relationship between AMISOM and in bringing peace and stability in Somalia, after conduction of the researcher, it has been concluded that there is positive between AMISOM and peace and stability in Somalia it means increasing AMISOM result increasing peace andstability of Somalia as We found from the analysis of the respondents Shows that 18.2% of the respondent were Answered Strongly agree and 40.9% of the respondents were answered agree, 9.1% of the respondent were answered strongly disagree and 20.9% of the respondents were answered disagree, this means AMISOM play crucial role in fighting terrorism in Somalia. The findings of the study from analysis of the respondent Shows that 23.6% of the respondent were Answered Strongly disagree and 28.6% of the respondents were answered disagree, 7.7% of the respondent were answered strongly agree and 19.1% of the respondents were answered Agree, As the explore the researcher investigated that 24.1% of the respondent were Answered Strongly agree and 38.2% of the respondents were answered agree, 17.2% of the respondent were answered disagree and 5.5% of the respondents were answered strongly disagree, , it means the majority of the respondents are both answered agree and strongly agree.

### Recommendations

This study has suggested Recommendations in three major areas:

1. **Re-arrange the AMISOM**

It is critical that AMISOM initiatives should be sustained if it is to effectively deliver on its mandate. The troop numbers should be increased and better resourced. More robust sources of funding e.g. the AU Peace Fund should be identified to meet the needs of the mission as well as guarantee its sustainability.

1. **Building the Capacity of the Police**

In line with its Strategic Concept, the Police component of AMISOM should continue to build on its Formed Police Units (FPUs) in order to be more effective in public order management.

In addition, AMISOM should enhance its support to the Somali Police Force and facilitate its transformation into a credible law enforcement component.

1. **Liberation and Effective Control of Occupied Areas**

Together with the Somali National Security Forces, AMISOM should not relent in its drive to liberate areas still occupied by al-Shabaab. Once liberated these areas should be effectively controlled to prevent the potential incursion of the vanquished militants. Better and sustained training of the national security forces as well as their upkeep and welfare are paramount as the exit strategy of AMISOM effectively depend on the capacity of these forces to take over and maintain the security in the country.
