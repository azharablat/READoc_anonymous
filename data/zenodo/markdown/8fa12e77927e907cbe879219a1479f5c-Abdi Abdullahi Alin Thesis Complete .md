### BACKGROUND

Following the end of the Cold War, the 1990s were characterized by fundamental changes around the world, and also, specifically in Africa, sweeping political changes were introduced in South Africa, Nelson Mandela was freed from prison and a conflict resolution process was initiated that led to the end of Apartheid in 1994. In addition, the civil war in Mozambique was eventually resolved through a negotiated settlement and the negotiations for the independence of Namibia were initiated between Pretoria and South West African People’s Organization (SWAPO), the conflict was eventually settled through negotiations in 1990, while the negotiations to end the civil war in Angola were taking place between the government and Jonas Savimbi. Yet, in Somalia, a civil war fought along parochial clan patronage lines was gaining momentum following the fall of Siad Barre’s government in January 1991 and triggered an unprecedented process of state failure, collapse and disintegration of the Somali state and the eventual emergence of a militia state. Fourteen peace processes have since failed to achieve sustainable peace and security in the country.

Post conflict peacebuilding is one of the most crucial elements for a war-torn country to reunite among all the warring groups, reconstruct the country and deter the country from returning to the conflict that paralysed the country’s political stability and development growth. One of the most essential components for the post conflict peacebuilding is, the national reconciliation process which aims to heal the grievances and wounds of the victims, the perpetrators and the civil war rivalries as well as to establish mechanisms ensuring community coherence and coexistence built through conciliation process of truthful and justice elements (Brouneus, 2003).

David Bloomfield presenting the concept of reconciliation and its elements states that reconciliation after fierce confrontation is the extensive, broad and deep inter societal relationship-building process whose integral elements contain justice, truth, healing and reparations. And describes these elements; (1) as they are the building blocks of reconciliation;

(2) therefore, they have ability to operate in one other in parallel harmonization towards the similar way; (3) are primarily interdependent and complimentary;(4) together contribute to the overall relationship-building process required for progress towards the (“perhaps idealistic”) aim of a reconciled society (Bloomfield 2006).

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

Throughout the last three decades, Somalia has been suffering an extending civil war (The network 2019). These conflicts were caused by several factors including the political, economic and land conflicts between various actors extending from the clans competing to obtain power to manage the scarce resource of the country (Elmi and Barise, 2006). There was also a rise of violent extremism like Al Shabab triggered by the weakness of the government. Devastating natural disasters of floods and droughts partook the increase of starvation and internal displacements occurring in the country. These issues caused the destruction of the country’s institutions, existing structures, and the trust in the government. The Somalia prolonged conflict impaired the social cohesion and the unity of the Somali people and left the country to be one of the most underdeveloped and fierce countries in Africa (The network, 2019).

During the absence of the central government in Somalia, various reconciliation conferences were held outside the country with the purpose to restore the state but unfortunately it was not succeeded to convey peace and stability in the country. These conferences have mostly been attentive towards state building by engaging merely politicians and militia leaders from the warring clans. These issues reduced the success of initiating peace as it was exclusively focused on certain actors rather than inclusive national social reconciliation (Keating & Waldman. 2018). Nevertheless, in the last fifteen years the country has been obtaining a level of stability while reconstructing its institutions and economy. In 2007 a national reconciliation conference was held in Mogadishu, the capital city of the country, was the first effort to address national level

social reconciliation but it was not succeeded due to the violent conflicts that existed in Mogadishu. Subsequently, several state-building conferences have been held in Mogadishu (The Network, 2019).

Since the collapse of the central government of Somalia fifteen peace reconciliation conferences were conducted aimed at building central government and most of them were held outside of Somalia while one was held inside Somalia, all these peace conferences failed to convene peace in the country because all these reconciliation conferences were focusing political agreements like power sharing and agreeing state building process rather than addressing the problems (grievances and interests) brought Somalia to its fraction dilemmas. Any government including the current did not invest meaningful efforts in reconciliation for the Somali people while the need for the reconciliation of Somalia people still is an outstanding issue which needs to be addressed to halt the conflicts in the country. Truth and justice broad based reconciliation is neglected to address in Somalia while it is a requirement for the Somali people (Gundel 2018).

**The first objective** of this study was to examine the kind Approaches of national reconciliation used in Somalia**.** Based on the findings from the result of the analysis shown in table and figures 4.1.6, 4.1.7, 4.1.8, 4.1.12, and 4.1.14, respectively showed that the kind Approaches of national reconciliation used in Somalia investigated in this study to achieve the best Approaches of national reconciliation the researcher asked some questions to our respondents and the results indicated that Somalia has been used in two distinct approaches which are top-down and bottom- up reconciliation approaches. So the Results indicate that both approaches worked in Somalia.

**The second objective** of this study was to explore role of the international community and neighbouring countries in the approaches of national reconciliation According to the second objective of this study, findings from the result in tables and figures 4.1.15, 4.1.16, and 4.1.17 respectively revealed that international community and neighbouring countries have been playing active role in the mediation and negotiation between the conflicting groups in Somalia. To achieve this Objective, the researcher asked some questions to our respondents and the results indicated that the international community played a vital role in Somali reconciliation processes**,** the results provided by this objective show that they had worked to bring together warring groups to reconcile their divergences.

the UN and international community supported the neighbouring countries to accommodate the Somali reconciliation conferences, UN together with international community, regional organizations and continental organizations such as Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), African Union collaborated on investing financially and technically on series of peace reconciliations intended to restore peace and establish state in Somalia hosted by neighbouring countries.

And in the last objectives of this research shows that civil society have been playing an active role in the recent reconciliation activities.

### CONCLUSION

The objective of this study was to investigate the Post Conflict National reconciliation in Mogadishu Somalia. Also discussed the background of the two variables and there are main problems that the study focused on, and also focused on three specific objectives including the kind Approaches of national reconciliation used in Somalia, The role of the international community and neighbouring countries in the approaches of national reconciliation as well as, civil society actor’s involvement in the national reconciliation initiative process. and also talked about some important significant for other people.

In chapter two the study deeply discussed among vast reconciliation literature which various scholars and authors have written on different researches with different opinions on how, what and when the reconciliation initiative is appropriate to start or end and what initiatives are considered as reconciliation or not. Besides that, the idea of reconciliation locates the first priority in the post conflict generation particularly the peace campaigners deem the reconciliation as being an essential requirement for durable peace.

And chapter three focused on some main points such as the research design of the study, the area of the study, the target population and sample of the study, the research instrument of the study and also the limitations of the study.

And in chapter four it was analysed and interpreted the data of the study and lastly we concluded with chapter five by discussing the findings of the data and recommendations.

Finally, the study has also shown the kind of reconciliation approach has been used in Somalia in achieving citizen’s participation. Because it’s essential in the peace building process and the social wellbeing, and it motivates our people, satisfies citizens, and creates good images for the whole country; these things may lead to the country gaining very good and excellent image.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

Based upon the study findings, many propositions and recommendations may arise those are useful to our country.

Basing generalizations on the findings of this study, the researcher recommends

 As the findings indicated Somalia has been used in two distinct approaches which are top-down approach and bottom-up approach and both worked there, but for further improvement bottom-up reconciliation approach should be emphasized.

 Since Somalia government is unable to invest national reconciliation processes UN and international community should continue funding Somali reconciliation processes until Somalia enables funding all reconciliation conferences across the country.

 As study declared the official end of the transitional government of Somalia has attracted new international support for Somalia, this change has expanded the role of civil society and offered a widened opportunity but civil society should have decision making in the national reconciliation processes across the country.

 The citizens should have the right to participate national reconciliation agendas and express their demand and opinions.

 The government should protect the rights of the citizen’s thoughts and view.

 The community should have the right to equal and effective access to public reconciliation processes in order to exercise his or her right of citizenship and wellbeing.
