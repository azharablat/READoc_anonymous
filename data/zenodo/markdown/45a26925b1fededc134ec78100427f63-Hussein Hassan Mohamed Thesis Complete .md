**Background of the study**

There are very few countries in the world that are satisfied with their public bureaucracies and civil service systems. Civil service reform is being discussed in Africa, Latin America, Europe and North America Ingraham (since 1996).

There are some that are dealing with legacies of past colonial civil service systems, while others are struggling with identifying the role of civil service in a changing political environment (Skogstad, 2000).

Whatever the case may be, civil service reforms are a topic of interest around the world. Each nation of the world is faced with the challenge of adjusting its domestic and international policies rather rapidly in response to forces of globalization and technological change (Farazmand, 1999).

The impact of the civil service in economic development, governance, and public service is vital irrespective of the institutional and structural differences across countries. In low-income countries, improvement in civil service reforms has faced significant challenges and is considered to have produced only mixed results over the past two to three decades (Andrews, 2013).

Low government effectiveness and corruption continue to be widely diagnosed in many countries. However, there are also partial indicators of progress on average, government effectiveness in low income countries has slightly declined rather than improved in recent years. However, it has to be kept in mind that a number of countries moved from low- to lower-middle-income status, and hence there has been a slight trend towards improvements among those countries (World Bank, 2008).

Good governance in the public sector aims to encourage better service delivery and improved accountability by establishing a standard for good governance in the public sector, Effective governance in the public sector encourages better decision making, efficient use of resources and strengthens accountability for the stewardship of resources (Mutahaba, 2012).

# Problem statement

Bearing in mind that human resources are the intellectual property of the government, civil servants have to also prove to be a good source of gaining competitive advantage and reforms. It‟s is one of the ways of developing government‟s intellectual property. The core aim of the civil service reform is to create a government employee with appropriate skill, capacities, ethos, and transparency needed to promote good governance, and the difference between expectation and reality indicates a need for the government to improve its public institutions and civil servants (Ayee, 2008).

Somaliland has faced the problems of massive corruption, favoritism, inadequate public service delivery, lack of transparency, accountability and other aspects normally faced by African government institutions, primarily due to the problems of good governance in addition to the lack of adequate resources (Farhan Haybe, 2017). However, these concerns contribute to different issues, which are the political, economic and social problems affecting the quality of life of the nation. They are also the most important obstacles to progress in a given state.

Most developed countries have undergone public and civil servant reforms to solve good governance problems. Like other countries, Somaliland has engaged in Civil Service Reform in 2016 to improve basic payroll, human resource development and policy management functions in selected central government agencies and line- ministries to facilitate good governance in order to resolve the above-mentioned problems. Public institutions in Somaliland have undergone a major restructuring process following this reform. Public agencies have been reformed, performance and transparency improved, corruption reduced. Civil servant pay and conditions improved, trained workers have been attracted and hired in the country, which is essentially useful for fostering good governance (Farhan Haybe, 2017).

Thus it is on this basis that this paper seeks to examine the effect of civil service reforms in selected Somaliland ministries and development agencies as it relates to good governance. Therefore, this paper was focused on answering the questions to what extent Civil service reform in Somaliland has contributed to good governance and the challenges it encountered during its implementation in Somaliland and finally analyzing the change scored to ensure good governance in Somaliland. This study is, therefore, justified on the basis of the existence of conflicting and confusing

Information among academics and politicians on the issues of impact of civil service reform to result in good governance. It‟s because of this that researcher became interested and motivated to find out the impact of Somaliland civil service reform in realizing good governance.

Based on the key findings of this study, the researcher would like to propose the following recommendations:

1. Because the civil service reform process is still being implemented in some government agencies, it should be necessary to re-evaluate how far it is going; it is also should build up capacity building programs for civil service commission officials and other stakeholders, which entails a thorough understanding of the reform and its impact on good governance.
2. Consultants and specialists are required in areas of change; civil servants need adequate training and career advancement, resulting in increased organizational and individual productivity. The framework of civil service

performance appraisals should be based on core competencies, with clear targets to improve core competencies over the next evaluation period.

1. There are challenges, as the respondents suggested; the government should formulate strategy to address them, with corruption being one of the most prominent.
