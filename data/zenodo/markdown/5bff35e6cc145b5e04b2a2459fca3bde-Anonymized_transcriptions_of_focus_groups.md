#### Dataset Description

##### 1.1 Brief description of the described research output

###### 1.1.1 What kind of research output are you describing?

Research Data

###### 1.1.2 Is it physical or digital?

Digital

###### 1.1.3 Are you generating or re-using it?

New

###### 1.1.4 What is the type of the described dataset?

Observational

This dataset contains qualitative primary data produced within the ActEU project. Specifically, this is observational data that has been captured in situ (real-time) and cannot be recaptured, recreated, or replaced (unique data).

###### 1.1.5 What is its format?

PDF

###### 1.1.6 What is its expected size?

<1GB

###### 1.1.7 Why are you collecting/generating or re-using it?

• To obtain information

• To share information

• To keep on record

• To make informed decisions

• To combine with other data

###### 1.1.8 What is its origin / provenance?

This data comes from the focus groups developed within the ActEU project.

###### 1.1.9 To whom might it be useful ('data utility')?

• Researchers

• Research communities

• Decision makers

##### 3.1.1 Making data findable, including provisions for metadata

###### 3.1.1.1 What type(s) of persistent identifier(s) are used for the described dataset / output?

Data identifiers

DOI

###### 3.1.1.2 Will you provide metadata for the described dataset / output?

Yes

###### 3.1.1.4 Do the metadata use standardised vocabularies?

Yes

Couldn't find it? Insert it manually

###### 3.1.1.5 Please provide URL/Description of used vocabularies

The standard vocabulary has not yet been decided.

###### 3.1.1.6 Are the metadata searchable?

Yes

###### 3.1.1.8 Are keywords provided in the metadata?

Yes

###### 3.1.1.9 Are metadata harvestable?

Yes

##### 3.2.1 Repository

###### 3.2.1.1 In which repository will the dataset / output be deposited?

GESIS Data Archive, Zenodo

The default repository of the ActEU project for depositing data, new knowledge, and tools is the GESIS Archive (https://www.gesis.org/en/home) and Zenodo (https://www.zenodo.org/ ). Both are compliant with the open data requirements of Horizon Europe program and OpenAire initiative.

###### 3.2.1.2 Is the selected repository a trusted source?

Yes

###### 3.2.1.5 Does the repository(ies) assign datasets / outputs with persistent identifiers?

Yes

###### 3.2.1.6 Does the repository(ies) resolve the identifiers to a digital object?

A DOI is assigned to all documents.

###### 3.2.1.7 Does the repository support versioning?

Yes

##### 3.2.2 Data

###### 3.2.2.1 What is the described dataset / output title?

Anonymized transcriptions of focus groups

###### 3.2.2.2 How is the dataset / output shared?

Open

###### 3.2.2.9 Please specify how the dataset / output will be accessed during and after the project ends

The dataset will be available in the GESIS Data Archive.

###### 3.2.2.10 Please specify how long after the project has ended the dataset / output will be made accessible for

ActEU’s items deposited in the GESIS data archive will be retained for the lifetime of the repository (which is currently the lifetime of the host institution, the GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences)

##### 3.2.3 Metadata

###### 3.2.3.1 Will you provide metadata even if the described dataset / output can not be openly shared?

Yes

GESIS is exploring how existing metadata standards (e.g. DDI, Dublin Core, DataCite, da|ra) can be used to develop networked infrastructures for finding research data. For this purpose, it is necessary that the metadata in the different systems can be mapped to one another, that means that they are compatible with one another. First results, such as the use of the metadata of the GESIS Dataset Catalog (DBK) in the B2Find (EUDAT) catalog as well as the OpenAire system, show how these networked catalogs enable the integrated search of research data from different scientific disciplines.

###### 3.2.3.2 Under which license will metadata be provided?

Creative Commons Zero (CC0)

##### 3.3 Making data and other outputs interoperable

###### 3.3.1 Does your (meta)data use a controlled vocabulary?

Yes

Couldn't find it? Insert it manually

The standard vocabulary has not yet been decided.

###### 3.3.3 Have you applied a standard schema for your (meta)data?

No

##### 5.1 Data Security

###### 5.1.2 What conditions do the security measures meet?

• Data storage

• Data recovery

During the lifetime of the project, the USAAR infrastructure for information technology (HIZ) will assure the safe local and/or cloud storage of new knowledge and tools, as well as the qualitative and quantitative data generated. Regular back-up and replication into multiple copies in the online system will be performed for the safe storage of the data.

###### 5.1.3 How will you preserve the described dataset / output in the long term?

ActEU’s items deposited in the GESIS data archive will be retained for the lifetime of the repository (which is currently the lifetime of the host institution, the GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences).

##### 6.1 Ethical aspects

###### 6.1.1 Are there any ethical or legal issues that can have an impact on sharing the described dataset / output?

yes

###### 6.1.2 Does the described dataset / output contain sensitive information?

Yes

###### 6.1.3 Does the described dataset / output contain personal data?

Yes

###### 6.1.4 What are the methods used for processing and accessing sensitive/personal information?

• Anonymising data where necessary

• Data accompanied by informed consent statements

Yes

##### 7.1 Other

###### 7.1.1 Do you make use of other procedures for data management?

No
