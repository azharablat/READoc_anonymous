# Background of OD Strategies

## BruTEL

One of the strategies identified in this case study (Pg Hj Idris & Ismail, 2019) is the transorganizational change based on the initial joint venture formed between TotalBru and JAQ Telserve to form GO-Mobile. It was then acquired by Darussalam Assets in July 2014 in which the outcome was the rebranding and restructure of the company as BruTEL Cellular. The technological strategies involved include the services offered in which they range from “post and prepaid residential mobile communication services” to “enterprise solutions for commercial entities”, as well as “voice, data and two-way text messaging on UMTS 2100 and GSM/GPRS 900 networks.

Re-engineering strategies noted in the study stated the contract formed with Onglai in 2014 in order to update the legacy infrastructure and launch a program to stabilise their networks. One of the projects include completely replacing the mobile core network and radio access network. Additionally, it involved the upgrade of backhaul network and all base stations from 3G to HSPA+. Furthermore, an official request to begin the trial of 4G networks was submitted in 2017 to AITI, Brunei’s telecoms regulatory body.

## Sumbiling’s Eco Village (SEV)

SEV is a community-based organisation and a non-profit organisation. In the context of community-based organisation, it involves the community development process in the form of a formal structured organisation. It also includes community members who share similar goals and interests. In this case study (Pg Hj Idris et al., 2019), the eco-village “shares the same ecological, social, cultural or even religious values”. Furthermore, SEV is a social enterprise company which aims to preserve the environment and bring economic benefits at the same time. This is also a community-based business in which the local community (especially the Iban tribe) participates. There are human resource management strategies involved in which SEV also boosts the local community's self-esteem as they recognize that they have been uneducated and not self-confident, but by sharing local knowledge, they feel inspired and enriched in information that enhances their self-confidence. Also, part of the owner’s potential initiatives is to make Sumbiling Eco Village an educational place for local and even foreign schools to learn about traditional Iban culture and nature conservation.

# Case Analysis

## BruTEL 's 'Going Paperless' Initiative

Based on the analysis on the issues addressed in the case study (Pg Hj Idris & Ismail, 2019), senior citizens who seem to be relatively less techno-savvy can contribute to the percentage of users who are less receptive to the online payment transition. Implementing e-billing systems for BruTel customers may mean losing a portion of its current users and future users because older people prefer the conventional billing system.

Another consideration is the ‘reminders’ factor where some customers, especially older generations, got used to using paper statements as a reminder of monthly payment. Issues that failing to provide physical bills as a visual reminder could result in missed payments. Customer Password Fatigue is a situation where customers have the challenge of recalling numerous passwords to reach various portals online. For instance, each profile may have different requirements. Lastly, when focusing on enrolment concerns. For example, the first process includes encouraging e-billing and paperless customers to become involved. 2nd phase is to ensure that consumers are enrolled via e-billing. When the enrolment process is complicated, customers can lose interest.

## Sumbiling Eco Village’s Challenges

Referring to the challenges faced by SEV from Pg Hj Idris et al.'s (2019) study, since plastics and ropes were originally restricted in the village, everything was made of natural materials. Ecosystem products and materials such as bamboos and woods have been used, but over time it deteriorated and the owner repaired it several times before the owner chose to replace it with new style materials to avoid wasting money by maintaining and restoring the natural ingredients. The weather does not permit these innovations in Brunei as the humidity destroys the structures, and the wind's salinity very rapidly erodes the materials.

SEV faced difficulties in hiring and retaining ecotourism expertise to improve their goods and services in Brunei. There is an immense shortage of skilled workers. Maintaining and sustaining the SEV mission is crucial to the importance of having more expertise and well-versed green business entrepreneurs.

The next challenge faced by SEV is competition from other outbound retreats nearby, such as Miri and Sarawak. One of the reasons is that such retreats has many local as well as international staff in support of the retreat. Thus, they might deliver more innovative and sustainable programs that are more attractive and desirable to tourists.

The eco-village will also require more accommodations in the future. As mentioned in the study (Pg Hj Idris et al., 2019), there were only 10 beds in the canvas tents, and it was expected that they were to build 30 beds in the future. In addition, Leslie Chiang plans to enhance the tourists' experience on camping in the jungle. The need for camping in the jungle is significant whilst at the same time they wanted to ensure that the customers feel comfortable in a jungle-like environment.

Increased tourism to vulnerable natural areas will endanger the integrity of ecosystems and local cultures without careful planning and management. In addition, the increase of visitors to ecologically sensitive areas will result in major deterioration of the ecosystem. Similarly, an influx of international tourists and resources will influence local communities and indigenous cultures in various ways. In addition, changes in climate, currency fluctuations, and political and social factors will make over-dependence on tourism business a risky endeavour. This provides valuable opportunities for both conservation and local economies, however. For instance, ecotourism will provide significant revenue for the conservation of Brunei national parks and other natural areas. In addition, it will provide the local communities with few other income-generating options to provide a viable alternative for economic growth. Furthermore, ecotourism will increase the level of awareness and advocacy among travellers, making them more active and successful conservation agents.

The owner of SEV, Leslie Chiang, encountered problems in obtaining daily electricity and in supplying portable water for several years. He also faced difficulties in promoting Sumbiling Eco Village with the goal of shifting mindsets about community ecotourism and other people in the country. Given the difficulties involved in promoting ecotourism, Sumbiling Eco Village has had a positive effect in raising understanding and fostering environmental sustainability in Temburong District. To achieve and retain Sumbiling Eco Village's green business status, Leslie Chiang aims to achieve sustainability through the use of the area's green building scheme to promote the design, development and retrofitting of buildings that use green building practises. Leslie Chiang is firmly committed to setting up Sumbiling Eco Village as a leader in Brunei ecotourism with a sustainable business, or a green business, in particular, a company that has minimal negative effect on the global or local climate, culture, society, or economy — a company that aims to achieve the triple bottom line.

## Society for Community Outreach and Training (SCOT)’s Green Xchange Project

One of the world's most common problems for NGOs is the ability to maintain their funding to carry out its long-term projects (Lewis & Kanji, 2009; Rehema, 2014). NGOs require funding to carry out programmes and keep the organisation going. Pehin Dato Musa & Pg Hj Idris (2019) mentioned that similar to other NGOs, SCOT also relies on getting sponsorships and contributions from the public for day-to-day operations. The financial instability prevents SCOT from further developing and extending its current CSR programmes. It is therefore important that SCOT has a diverse source of funds and not rely solely on donations from the respective governments and private organisations. Alymkulova and Seipulnik (2005) acknowledge that diversification of revenue sources is the most viable financing strategy. They also point out that a sustainable approach to NGO funding avoids reliance on any single source of income, whether external or internal.

Contributions from foreign governments or organisations abroad are often difficult to obtain because contributions from other nations may have their own provisions, which may clash with national values. Therefore, it is a difficult task to raise funds for projects and programmes. Anwar continues to search for more money to finance the next project of SCOT as soon as one project is done. Anwar constantly searches for enough money to cover the costs of each project / event; nevertheless, he found it difficult to provide enough resources to develop the organisation as a whole. Financial help is seldom provided, and more popular are in-kind benefits such as free use of facilities and technical assistance (Pehin Dato Musa & Pg Hj Idris, 2019).

Anwar decided to find more viable and creative ways to fund their projects in order to fulfil the goal of SCOT and "resource mobilisation" as well. Resource mobilisation is a mechanism by which both financial and non-financial resources are mobilised to support organisational operations, either externally or internally (Rehema, 2014). Resource mobilisation has two additional concepts; one is that non-financial resources are essential, and the other is that the company should produce certain resources internally rather than from others (Batti, 2014). Aside from externally generated financial sources, the company may also generate resources internally.

The resource mobilisation process consists of three aspects: Resource, Mechanism and Providers (Batti, 2014). The first aspect may be consisted of “cash, technical support, human resources, subsidised service and facilities, equipment, knowledge and products”. Mechanism include “the submission of grant proposals, special events, small businesses and application for donations”. Lastly, providers may be in terms of “International NGOs, bilateral and multi-lateral agencies, cooperatives, government and businesses among others”. In the context of SCOT, it may be in the form of coordinating events and raising donations, receiving in-kind gifts, and generating income through fee-paying workshops and seminars, as well as helping volunteers. Hence, finding new funding sources is essential for SCOT to ensure financial sustainability without sacrificing its goal (Pehin Dato Musa & Pg Hj Idris, 2019).

Furthermore, a conceptual framework generated by Omeri (2015) (Figure 1 in Appendices) demonstrates the independent variables which contribute to strategic interventions which may result in the dependent variables of obtaining financial sustainability of NGOs.

# Alternative Solutions

## BruTEL 's 'Going Paperless' Initiative

The table shown below are the alternative solutions to the key issues addressed from the case study (Pg Hj Idris & Ismail, 2019) provided by CheckFree Corporation (CheckFree, n.d.):

| Enrolment | “Consumers should figure out where to enroll on your platform very quickly and the procedure should be painless. The details needed to register should be readily accessible to the customer and should be limited to what is necessary to satisfy the security requirements of your company in order to verify the identity of a customer. Minimizing the number of fields needed can decrease the risk of data entry errors leading to irritation and removal from your site. It is also critical that e-bill enrolment also be made available via offline channels. Let customer service representatives agree to register customers when they are on the phone. If you have a place that customers visit in person, do provide for enrollment at such locations”. |
| --- | --- |
| User Interface | “When designed correctly, the user interface (UI) will play a leading role in creating a successful customer experience and driving acceptance of e-bills. To help drive paperless adoption, the most critical best practice is to constantly inform customers about what an e-bill is and the many personal and environmental benefits. In addition to describing an e-bill regularly and illustrating its advantages in your web, provide a thumbnail picture of your e-bill to help users create a clear connection between the paper bill and the e-bill”. |
| Functionality | “The abundance of customer experience can have a significant effect on bringing more customers online. By introducing a user-tested application that meets their needs, you can promote the use of your online platform by consumers, and eventually paperless billing. For example:   * + - Provide flexibility for consumers to select their preferred payment method (scheduled, one-time, periodic, Auto Pay) and their preferred means of financing (checking account, credit card, debit card)     - Enable billing-related updates via multiple channels, such as e-mails or text messages     - Store enough billing history with fast and easy retrieval capabilities. “60% of e-bill users would be willing to turn off their paper bills if they had access to a bill history of at least 12 months.” CheckFree Consumer Insights, Consumer Billing and Payment Trends, February 2008” |

* Understand the Resource Mobilization Cycle

The resource mobilization cycle is a tool used by strategic organization to help plan, monitor and develop their resource mobilization activities. It involves 3 phases:

* + Planning-assessment and design element
  * Act-implementation (identify, engage, negotiate, manage and report and communicate results) ongoing process
  * Reflect on the lessons learned and revise strategy for purposes of redesign. The action plan and strategy are monitored and the organization reflects on successes and challenges then through the lessons learned they tailor and refocus strategy for greater success.
* Appreciate and Analyze Competition

Increased competition for scarce grant resources requires organizations to start thinking of new options for diverse and multiple funding streams that will support organizations to undertake their projects. According to Yuwen (2011) raising funds has become an important aspect for NGOs. For many organizations competition has a negative connotation and is reserved for use by private or for the profit sector. It is often seen to mean dominating the market by destroying or engulfing your competition. For those that see themselves as collaborative and sector building being competitive sounds unethical and they wonder why they have to compete. However, understanding organizations within one’s sector or other sectors needs to be an integral part of an organization’s environmental scan. In doing so an organization may discover what the other organization does threatens the sustainability or presents new opportunities for mobilizing resources through doing a joint program.

* Enhancement of Organization’s Internal Capacity

Resource mobilization is a continuous process and it is important for an organization to build its internal capacity to mobilize resources. Organizations sometimes underestimate the time, resources and skills involved in resource mobilization and also maintaining good communication and relations with donors. It takes resources to raise resources and organizations need experienced and skilled personnel and board members in resource mobilization if they are to be successful to get resources.

* Leadership Role in Resource Mobilization Resource mobilization is a strategic process within an organization carried out at the executive level and should not be looked at as a different or minor task within the organization’s management team. According to DiMattia (2008) it is important to have someone at the top with the belief, energy and time to spearhead fundraising efforts. NGO leaders are sometimes forced to follow the money and this allows donors to dictate the scope and direction of their activities, or else receive no funds at all. Hence it is crucial for an organizations leadership to articulate the vision for what they want the organization to achieve and what will be the impact of the success and how the interest of the potential funders will be realized without compromising the organisation mission.
* Transparency and Accountability for NGOs

A good reputation is linked with integrity and the reputation of an organization’s and its individual players are its most valuable asset and its highest risk (Pettey, 2008). An organization having an accountable style of working can expand its relations and contacts quickly. It is common knowledge that the NGO sector in many countries is being watched by government, donors, press, and the general public and creating and maintaining a good, credible public image in such an atmosphere of suspicion and cynicism is a tremendous challenge for many organizations. According to Pettey (2008), without public trust fundraising cannot happen and if people don’t believe an organization will use their money appropriately, they will simply not give.

* Continuous Learning and Improvement in Resource Mobilization Strategies

Frostein (2013) states that organizations need to base their fundraising on the behaviour of donors by monitoring feedback and appeals sent to them. This means planning an event where donors have an interest. One organization reviewed their process of conducting first time meetings with potential donors that was initially done by staff and instead used a consulting company and set up first time meetings with potential donors this freed the staff from organizing such events to concentrate more on the follow-ups and deepening relationships with donors (Hall 2013). Other methods would include tracking fundraising success and providing rewards or bonus to individuals and teams once the goals are achieved or exceeded (Berkshire, 2013). For example Save the Children found a creative way of saying thank you to its donors by using the fastest talking woman to say thank you (Flandez, 2013).

* The Quality of Financial Management and Accounting Organizations that have financial management systems that meet the standards required by external donors is another factor that contributes to an organizations ability to mobilize resources. Donors are comfortable with an organization that has clear financial reporting and auditing arrangements and where adequate monitoring and attribution of costs to activities and results exists. Clear accounting systems to distribute and track that resources get to where they are intended are things that donors appreciate. Acknowledging a donors resource contribution through managing, monitoring and reporting on the use of resources vis a vis agreed mechanisms which are often spelled out in the agreements is crucial to maintain good relations with the donor and forms a foundation for potential ongoing resources and must not be overlooked.
