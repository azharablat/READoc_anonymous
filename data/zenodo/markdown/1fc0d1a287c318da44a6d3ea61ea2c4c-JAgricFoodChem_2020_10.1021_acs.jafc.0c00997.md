# ABSTRACT

1. The transglycosylation activity of a novel commercial β-galactosidase from *Bifidobacterium*
2. *bifidum* (Saphera) was evaluated. The optimal conditions of operation of this enzyme, measured
3. with *o*-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside, were pH 6.0 and 40 °C. Although at low lactose
4. concentrations the character of this enzyme was basically hydrolytic, an increase of lactose
5. concentration to 400 g/L resulted in a significant formation (107.2 g/L, 27% yield) of prebiotic
6. galactooligosaccharides (GOS). The maximum amount of GOS was obtained at a lactose
7. conversion of approximately 90%, which contrasts with other β-galactosidases, for which the
8. highest GOS yield is achieved at 40-50% lactose conversion. Using HPAEC-PAD,
9. semipreparative HPLC-HILIC, MS, 1D and 2D NMR, we determined the structure of most of
10. the GOS synthesized by this enzyme. The main identified products were Gal-β(13)-Gal-
11. β(14)-Glc (3´-*O*--galactosyl-lactose), Gal-β(1→6)-Glc (allolactose), Gal-β(13)-Glc (3-
12. galactosyl-glucose), Gal-β(1→3)-Gal (3-galactobiose) and the tetrasaccharide Gal-β(13)-
13. Gal-β(13)-Gal-β(14)-Glc. In general, the *B. bifidum* β-galactosidase showed a tendency to
14. form β(13) linkages followed by β(16), and more scarcely β(14) .

# INTRODUCTION

* 1. -Galactosidases (-D-galactoside galactohydrolases, EC 3.2.1.23) catalyze the hydrolysis
  2. of different oligosaccharides with a galactosyl moiety located at the nonreducing end.*1,2* The
  3. dairy industry is taking advantage of this reaction to remove lactose from milk to obtain
  4. lactose-free products.*3,4* Due to the high amount of people suffering from lactose intolerance,
  5. the demand for lactose-free products is steadily increasing.*5* Apart from its hydrolytic activity,
  6. -galactosidases are also able to catalyze transgalactosylation reactions in which lactose ‒or
  7. other carbohydrates‒ act as acceptor molecules of galactosyl units yielding di-, tri, tetra- or
  8. even higher oligomers called galactooligosaccharides (GOS).*6-9* GOS chemically resemble the
  9. oligosaccharides present in human milk (HMOS) ‒which are structurally more complex‒, and
  10. both families exhibit prebiotic properties.*10-12* More precisely, they improve the gastrointestinal
  11. microbiota by promoting the growth and/or the activity of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli,*13*
  12. which are regarded to have a beneficial effect on human health.*14,15* In addition to their prebiotic
  13. activity, several studies describe that GOS are non-cariogenic, diminish the serum cholesterol
  14. level, prevent colon cancer, enhance the digestibility of milk and improve the lactose
  15. tolerance.*16,17* Therefore, -galactosidases from generally recognized as safe (GRAS)
  16. microorganisms have attracted the attention of the dairy industries for enriching their products
  17. with GOS and developing novel functional foods.*13,18*
  18. The yield and the composition of the synthesized GOS are influenced by the source of the
  19. enzyme and several reaction parameters including lactose concentration, pH, temperature, and
  20. water activity.*19-21* The percentage of GOS in the mixtures may vary in a wide range between
  21. 15-55 % (*w/w*) depending on such conditions.*22-25* The health promoting properties of GOS
  22. depend on their chemical composition, structure and degree of polymerization, which are highly
  23. influenced by the origin of the β-galactosidase.*10* The chemical structure of the synthesized
  24. oligosaccharides (number of hexose units, types of linkages between them and carbohydrate
  25. composition) may affect their fermentation pattern by probiotic bacteria in the human
  26. intestine.*26,27* Apparently, GOS mixtures synthesized by -galactosidases from probiotic
  27. microorganisms are consumed faster by probiotic species than those produced by other -
  28. galactosidases.*28-30*
  29. *Bifidobacterium* species are one of the most common organisms in the human gastrointestinal
  30. tract.*30,31* It has been demonstrated that GOS produced by -galactosidases from
  31. *Bifidobacterium* species have a different structure and significantly higher prebiotic potential
  32. compared with commercial mixtures of GOS,*28,32* probably due to the prevalence of β(13) and
  33. β(16) linkages,*25* whilst β(14) and β(16) bonds prevail in commercial GOS.*6,33*
  34. Interestingly, GOS synthesis catalyzed by β-galactosidases from bifidobacteria is not inhibited
  35. by the presence of glucose or galactose,*34,35* which are commonly recognized as inhibitors of
  36. other -galactosidases.*36*
  37. In the present work, we evaluated the transgalactosylation activity of a novel commercial -
  38. galactosidase from *Bifidobacterium bifidum* (Saphera) developed to obtain lactose-free
  39. products. A detailed chemical characterization of the synthesized GOS was performed.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

## Materials

* + 1. The commercial β-galactosidase Saphera® (Novozym 46091) from *Bifidobacterium bifidum* was
    2. kindly supplied by Novozymes A/S (Bagsværd, Denmark). Lactose and *o*-nitrophenyl--D-
    3. galactopyranoside (ONPG) were from Sigma-Aldrich. The standards 3-*O-**-*galactosyl-
    4. galactose (3-galactobiose), 4-*O*-*-*galactosyl-galactose (4-galactobiose), 6-*O*-*-*galactosyl-
    5. galactose (6-galactobiose), 6-*O*--galactosyl-glucose (allolactose) and 4’-*O*--galactosyl-
    6. lactose were from Carbosynth (Berkshire, UK). The rest of standards were synthesized
    7. following previous works developed in our laboratory.*22,37,38* All other reagents and solvents
    8. were of the highest available purity and used as purchased.

## Determination of β-galactosidase activity

* + 1. The assay of β-galactosidase activity was performed using *o*-nitrophenyl--D-
    2. galactopyranoside (ONPG) as substrate. The activity was measured at 40 ºC following *o*-
    3. nitrophenol (ONP) release at 405 nm using a microplate reader (Versamax, Molecular Devices).
    4. The reaction was started by adding 10 L of the enzyme solution (properly diluted) to 190 L
    5. of 15 mM ONPG in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). The increase of absorbance at 405 nm
    6. was followed continuously at 40 ºC during 5 min. The molar extinction coefficient of *o*-
    7. nitrophenol at pH 6.8 was 1627 M-1 cm-1. One unit of activity (*U*) was defined as that
    8. corresponding to the hydrolysis of 1 mol of ONPG per min under the above specified
    9. conditions.

## Optimum temperature and pH

* + 1. The optimum temperature for the β-galactosidase activity was determined by mixing 50 µL of
    2. a properly diluted enzyme solution with 450 µL of 15 mM ONPG in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
    3. (pH 6.8). The mixture was incubated for 10 min at different temperatures between 10 ºC and
    4. 70 ºC. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 µL of 0.4 M Na2CO3 and the absorbance at 405
    5. nm was measured in endpoint mode using a microplate reader (Versamax, Molecular Devices).
    6. The optimum pH for the β-galactosidase activity was measured at 40 ºC by performing the
    7. enzyme assay in kinetic mode at different pH values (between 2.0 and 9.0), under the conditions
    8. described above. The molar extinction coefficient of *o*-nitrophenol for each pH was determined 89 (pH 2.0, 378.65 M-1 cm -1; pH 3.0, 383.85 M-1 cm -1; pH 4.0, 441.98 M-1 cm -1; pH 5.0, 495.38 90 M-1 cm -1; pH 6.0, 661.65 M-1 cm -1; pH 7.0, 2043.5 M-1 cm -1; pH 8.0, 4397.83 M-1 cm -1; pH

1. 9.0, 4403 M-1 cm -1). To minimize the buffer effect, solutions of 15 mM ONPG were prepared
2. using 0.1 M Britton & Robinson buffer,*39* adjusted to the required pH. All the experiments were
3. performed in triplicate and the error was expressed as the standard deviation of the three
4. measurements.

## pH and thermal stability of β-galactosidase

1. In order to evaluate the thermostability of the β-galactosidase, the enzyme was incubated in
2. 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 6.8 for 1 hour at different temperatures ranging from 4 ˚C to 70 ˚C.
3. The remaining activity towards ONPG was determined by performing enzymatic activity
4. measurements as described above. The evaluation of the stability towards pH was performed
5. incubating enzyme samples at 40 ˚C for 3 hours at various pH values (between pH 2.0 and pH
6. 12.0) using the Britton & Robinson buffer. The remaining activity was measured as described
7. above.

## Production of galactooligosaccharides from lactose

1. Lactose (400 g/L 34.7% *w/w*) was dissolved in 20 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). The
2. biocatalyst was then added to adjust the -galactosidase activity in the reaction mixture to 1.5
3. U/mL (ONPG units). The mixture was incubated at 40C in an orbital shaker (Vortemp 1550)
4. at 200 rpm. At different times, 750 μL aliquots were harvested from the reaction vessel. The
5. enzyme was inactivated by incubating the samples in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf) for 10 min at
6. 96 °C. Samples were then filtered using micro-centrifuge filter tubes, with 0.45 m cellulose
7. acetate filters (National Scientific) at 6000 rpm for 5 min. The samples were diluted with water
8. (1:400 and 1:4000) and then analyzed using HPAEC-PAD.

## HPAEC-PAD analysis

1. Products were analyzed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed
2. amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) on a ICS3000 Dionex system (Dionex Corp., CA)
3. consisting of a SP gradient pump, an autosampler (model AS-HV) and an electrochemical
4. detector with a gold working electrode and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode. All eluents were
5. degassed by flushing with helium. A pellicular anion-exchange 4 x 250 mm Carbo-Pack PA-1
6. column (Dionex) connected to a 4 x 50 mm CarboPac PA-1 guard column was used at 30 °C.
7. Eluents were prepared with Milli-Q water and 50% (w/v) NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich). The initial
8. mobile phase was 15 mM NaOH at 1.0 mL/min for 12 min. A mobile phase gradient from 15 to
9. 200 mM NaOH was performed in 15 min at 1.0 mL/min, and it was maintained for 25 min. The
10. peaks were analyzed by using Chromeleon software. The identification of the different
11. carbohydrates was performed on the basis of commercially available standards or products
12. purified in the laboratory. For those compounds whose standards were not available at sufficient
13. amount, quantification was done based on the calibration curve of standards with the same
14. degree of polymerization.

## Purification of GOS

1. For the purification of unidentified GOS, the reaction was carried out as described above and
2. stopped after 22 h by heating the solution for 10 min at 96 ºC to inactivate the biocatalyst. The
3. reaction mixture was filtered using 0.45 µm paper filters and purified by semipreparative
4. hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HPLC-HILIC). A quaternary pump (Delta 600,
5. Waters) coupled to a Lichrosorb-NH2 column (5 m, 10 x 250 mm, Merck) was used. The
6. column temperature was kept at 25 ºC. The acetonitrile/water 75/25 (*v/v*) mobile phase was
7. conditioned with helium and used as at a flow-rate of 6.25 mL/min for 43 min. Peaks were
8. detected by using an evaporative light-scattering detector DDL-31 (Eurosep) equilibrated at
9. 60 C. A three-way flow splitter (model Accurate, Dionex) and a fraction collector II (Waters)
10. were employed. The fractions containing the main peaks were collected and the solvent was
11. removed by rotary evaporation.

## Mass spectrometry

1. The MS analysis of purified galactooligosaccharides was assessed using a mass spectrometer
2. with hybrid QTOF analyzer (model QSTAR, Pulsar i, AB Sciex). The sample was analyzed by
3. direct infusion and ionized by electrospray (with methanol containing 1% of NH4OH as ionizing
4. phase) in positive reflector mode.

## Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)

1. The structure of the oligosaccharides was determined by using a combination of 1D
2. (1H, 13C) and 2D (COSY, NOESY, TOCSY, HSQC, HSQC-TOCSY, HMBC) NMR
3. techniques. The samples were dissolved in D2O, using TSP-d4 [3-
4. (trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt] as chemical shift reference.
5. Chemical shifts were expressed in parts per million with respect to the 0 ppm point of
6. TSP. The spectra were measured in a Bruker 800 AVIII spectrometer equipped with a
7. 4-channels cryo TCI probe, with gradients in the Z axis, at a temperature of 298K. For
8. the 1H-13C heteronuclear correlations (HSQC, HQSC-TOCSY, HMBC), values of 5 ppm
9. and 1-2K points, for the 1H dimension, and 70 ppm and 384 points for the 13C
10. dimension, were used. For the 1H-1H homonuclear experiments (COSY, NOESY,
11. ROESY), 5 ppm windows were used in both dimensions with a 1-2K x 384 point matrix.
12. For the NOESY experiments, mixing times of 500-600 ms were used. The spinlock time
13. was set to 300 ms for ROESY and 60/100 ms for HSQC-TOCSY experiments. The
14. standard pulse sequences used were provided by Bruker.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

1. **Effect of pH and temperature on activity and stability of *Bifidobacterium bifidum* -**

## galactosidase

1. The hydrolytic activity of commercial *Bifidobacterium bifidum* β-galactosidase (Saphera),
2. measured with *o*-nitrophenyl--D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) as substrate, was 1506 ± 0.1
3. U/mL, determined at 40 ºC and pH 6.8, which are the optimal conditions reported for several -
4. galactosidases from *Bifidobacteria.34,35,40*
5. In order to determine the optimum conditions of operation of this novel enzymatic
6. preparation, a series of activity assays were performed at a fixed pH value (6.8) and different
7. temperatures. The optimum temperature of the -galactosidase from *B. bifidum* (Saphera) was
8. found to be 40 ˚C (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, the thermostability was analyzed measuring the
9. residual activity the enzyme in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) after 1 h incubation. The β-
10. galactosidase showed a rapid inactivation at temperatures above 50 ˚C (Fig. 1b). The thermal
11. stability was significantly smaller than that reported for other related enzymes, such as β-
12. glycosidases from *Sulfolobus solfataricus* and *Pyrococcus furiosus.41* However, the β-
13. galactosidase from *B. bifidum* showed a higher thermostability compared to -galactosidases
14. from other *Bifidobacterium* species like *B. breve.25*
15. The optimum pH of this preparation was also studied (Fig. 2a). The highest activity with
16. ONPG was obtained at pH 6.0. Regarding the stability of the enzyme at different pH values, the
17. results showed that the β-galactosidase displayed good stability in the pH range 5.0-10.0, after
18. 3 hours of incubation at 40 ºC (Fig. 2b). At pH 3.0 and 11.0 the inactivation of the enzyme was
19. very fast. In this context, the -galactosidase from *Bifidobacterium breve* was rapidly
20. inactivated at pH 9.0.*25* Our results fit well with those described by Tzortis *et al.* using whole
21. cells of *B. bifidum* NCIMB 41171, for which the optimum pH and temperature were 6.8-7.0 and
22. 40 ˚C, respectively.*34* The related β-galactosidase from *B. longum* showed optimal pH and
23. temperature of 5.8-6.8 and 45°C, respectively.*35*
24. **GOS specificity of *B. bifidum* -galactosidase**
25. The ability of *B. bifidum* β-galactosidase to synthesize galactooligosaccharides (GOS) was
26. assessed. First, we followed by HPAEC-PAD the hydrolysis of lactose at 160 g/L under the
27. optimal conditions (pH 6.0, 40 °C). As shown in Fig. 3a, the main reaction catalyzed by this
28. enzyme under these conditions was the hydrolysis. However, the formation of several
29. transgalactosylation products was observed.
30. We further increased the lactose concentration to 400 g/L to promote transfer reaction. The
31. HPAEC-PAD chromatogram (Fig. 3b) showed at least 19 peaks of which numbers *1*, *2* and *5*
32. corresponded to galactose, glucose and lactose, respectively. The main reaction products
33. corresponded to peaks *10*, *15* and *19*. We were able to purify peaks *15* and *19* by semipreparative
34. HILIC for their characterization. For peak *15,* the major signal in the mass spectrum in positive
35. mode (Fig. 4A) was at *m/z* 527.16, corresponding to the M+[Na]+ ion of a trisaccharide. The 1D
36. and 2D NMR spectra indicated that the structure of the compound fitted well with the
37. trisaccharide 3’-O-β-galactosyl-lactose [Gal-β(13)-Gal-β(14)-Glc], which was previously
38. identified and characterized in our laboratory studying the GOS synthesis with β-galactosidase
39. from *Aspergillus oryzae.22*
40. The main signal in the mass spectrum of peak *19* (Fig. 4B) was at *m/z* 689.21, corresponding
41. to the M+[Na]+ ion of a tetrasaccharide. The 1H-NMR-based information for the major product
42. of this peak was fairly similar to that recorded for peak *15*, although it clearly displayed one
43. additional anomeric proton (Figs. 5A and 5B). The analysis demonstrated that the Gal rings
44. were not substituted at position 4, and only 3-Gal glycosylated moieties could be found. As for
45. peak *15,* the existing Glc ring was glycosylated position 4. Therefore, the structure of the
46. compound was determined to be 3´-O-β-(3-galactobiosyl)-lactose [Gal-β(13)-Gal-β(13)-
47. Gal-β(14)-Glc] in a non-ambiguous manner. Fig. 5 shows the similarity of the 1H-NMR
48. spectra of peaks *15* and *19*. Both positions α- and β- at the reducing end were unambiguously
49. identified for these compounds by the HSQC spectrum.
50. Peaks *8* and *9* were identified as the trisaccharide 6’-*O*--galactosyl-lactose and the
51. disaccharide 3-*O*--galactosyl-glucose, respectively, using purified standards from *K. lactis* -
52. galactosidase reactions.*42* With commercial standards it was also possible to identify peak *12* as
53. the trisaccharide 4’-O--galactosyl-lactose and several disaccharides with different glycosidic
54. bonds, involving two units of galactose (peak *3,* 6-galactobiose; peak *6,* 3-galactobiose; peak *7,*
55. 4-galactobiose) or galactose-glucose (peak *4,* Gal-β(16)-Glc, allolactose; peak *9*, Gal-

217 β(13)-Glc).

1. One more reaction product (peak *13*) was also partially purified by semipreparative HPLC.
2. The mass spectrum showed that the main signal corresponded to a trisaccharide. Although the
3. purity of this sample was not enough for a precise structure determination, the identity of the
4. components of the mixture was further studied. From the NMR data, different glycosylation
5. positions could be detected. For the Gal-Gal linkages, both (13) and (14) disaccharide
6. fragments were found, with similar proportions. For the Gal-Glc linkages, the (14) position
7. was predominant, but minor (13) as well as minute fractions of (12) linked moieties were
8. also detected. Therefore, the mixture within peak *13* is composed of the Gal-β(13)-Gal-
9. β(14)-Glc and Gal-β(14)-Gal-β(14)-Glc trisaccharides as major products, together with
10. the Gal-β(13)-Gal-β(13)-Glc, Gal-β(14)-Gal-β(13)-Glc analogues as minor
11. components. Such assignations were performed on the basis of previous publications.*43-46*
12. Additionally, small amounts of products with the Glc moiety glycosylated at position 2 were
13. present.
14. In a recent paper, using the β-galactosidase activity from several *Pantoea anthophila* strains,
15. we were able to identify peak *14* as 3’-*O*-galactosyl-allolactose (Gal-β(13)-Gal-β(16)-
16. Glc).*47* Regarding peak *10*, one of the most abundant in the GOS mixture, we believe that it
17. could be composed by three galactosyl residues bound by β(13) linkages [Gal-β(13)-Gal-
18. β(13)-Gal, 3-galactotriose]. This assumption is based on the enzyme specificity, the relative
19. retention times and the presence of a significant amount of 3-galactobiose, which could serve as
20. galactosyl acceptor. However, we were not able to isolate it with enough purity for NMR
21. analysis. Peaks *11*, *16*, *17* and *18* remained unidentified, but all of them were minor components
22. of the mixture.
23. Our results fit well with those obtained using other *B*. *bifidum* strains. Depeint et al.*48* and
24. Goulas et al.*49* reported the presence of β(13) linkages, with less participation of β(14) and
25. β(16) bonds, in the GOS mixture obtained with β-galactosidase from *B*. *bifidum*
26. NCIMB41171. However, Rabiu et al. identified, in addition to β(13) linkages, several β(16)
27. and β(14) bonds.*28* This partially agrees with our findings, but it is well studied that there are
28. more than one β-galactosidase in *Bifidobacteria* strains, and the synthesized oligosaccharides
29. may vary.*40,49*

## Progress of GOS formation

1. The progress of GOS formation was followed by HPAEC-PAD. Experimental conditions were
2. 400 g/L lactose in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 40 ºC and 1.5 U/mL (ONPG units).
3. Table 1 shows the concentrations of the main reaction products at different times. Under the
4. above conditions, the point of maximum GOS production (107.2 g/L, 27% of total sugars in the
5. mixture) was obtained at 50.5 h. At this point, the rest of components in the mixture were
6. glucose (38%), galactose (26%) and lactose (9%). It is worth noting that the time required to get
7. the maximum GOS yield depends inversely on the amount of enzyme; however, as occurs in
8. this kind of kinetically-controlled reactions,*50-52* the GOS concentration at this point is not
9. affected by the amount of biocatalyst. Rabiu et al. reported GOS yields between 24.7-47.6%
10. employing 30% (w/w) lactose and five different species of bifidobacteria, including *B. bifidum*
11. BB-12 (37.6% yield).*28* Tzortzis et al. demonstrated that an increase in lactose concentration
12. reported a higher yield of GOS using whole cells *B*. *bifidum* NCIMB41171 with β-galactosidase
13. activity. Maximum GOS yield was 35% employing 55% (w/w) lactose.*34*
14. At the point of maximum GOS concentration, the most abundant GOS corresponded to 3’-
15. galactosyl-lactose (17.7 g/L), allolactose (16.2 g/L), 3-O-β-galactosyl-glucose (9.0 g/L), and 3-
16. galactobiose (8.2 g/L), apart from unidentified peak *10*. These results confirm that the enzyme
17. has a clear tendency to form β(13) linkages followed by β(16). However, only a small
18. proportion of products containing new β(14) linkages were observed. It is worth noting that
19. the GOS synthesis using *B. bifidum* -galactosidase resulted in a high amount of disaccharides
20. (approx. 40.4 g/L), with allolactose, 3-O--galactosyl-glucose and 3-galactobiose as the main
21. components of this fraction. In this context, Böger et al. recently reported that most probiotic
22. strains of gut bacteria exhibited a preference for DP2 galactooligosaccharides.*53*
23. Fig. 6 represents the profile of GOS concentration as a function of lactose conversion. It is
24. remarkable that the GOS concentration increased progressively until 80% of initial lactose has
25. disappeared. Then, the yield of GOS was nearly invariable until approximately 93% of lactose
26. was consumed. These results contrast with those obtained with *Bacillus circulans37* and
27. *Aspergillus oryzae22* β-galactosidases, for which the maximum concentration of GOS was
28. achieved at approximately 40-50% of lactose conversion. Thereafter, GOS are hydrolyzed by
29. the enzyme, in particular those containing β(14) linkages. The profile obtained with *B.*
30. *bifidum* -galactosidase resembles that of *Kluyveromyces lactis* lactase, as the maximum GOS
31. yield was also achieved at approximately 95% of lactose conversion.*42* In this context, Hsu et
32. al., using a β-galactosidase from *B. longum*, reported a maximum GOS yield of 32.5%, which
33. obtained at approximately 60% lactose conversion, and was followed by a hydrolysis of the
34. synthesized GOS.*35*
35. In conclusion, the commercial preparation Saphera gave rise to a moderate GOS yield (27%)
36. compared with other -galactosidases. However, the predominance of β(13) linkages in the
37. synthesized GOS has several advantages with respect to other commercial GOS mixtures. First,
38. the production of GOS with Saphera can be easily controlled because GOS hydrolysis only takes
39. place when approximately 95% of the initial lactose has disappeared. Second, it has been
40. reported that GOS containing β(13) bonds are metabolized by probiotic bacteria faster than
41. similar GOS containing other linkages, in particular β(14).*29*

Figure 5. 1H-NMR spectra of the reaction products corresponding to peaks 13, 15 and 19. The major product for peak 19 (A) corresponds to the tetrasaccharide Gal-β(1→3)-Gal-β(1→3)-Gal-β(1→4)-Glc(α/β). For peak 15 (B) the major product is Gal-β(1→3)-Gal-β(1→4)-Glc(α/β). For peak 13 (C) a mixture of trisaccharides (according to MS) containing all the possibilities for Gal-β(1→3/1→4)-Gal-β(1→4/1→3/1→2)-Glc(α/β) is obtained. For the three peaks, small amounts of oligosaccharides with the reducing Glc residue glycosylated at position 2 have been found (signals at 5.4-5.5 ppm).
