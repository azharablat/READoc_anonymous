# 1.0 Introduction

This research paper attempt to do multiple case analysis on three case studies namely; Social Community Outreach Training (SCOT)’s Green Xchange project, BruTel’s “Goingpaperless” initiative and Sumbiling Eco Village: Promoting the Ecotourism in the Temburong District.

## 1.1 Brief background

SCOT’s was first founded by Anwar Muhamad and was established in 2011. It is a registered NGO based in Brunei that was concerned on performing the Corporate Social Responsibilities(CSR) and its major purpose was to lessen the poverty. Other than that, SCOT’s objective was also to protect the environment. Thus, the projects that have been carried were related to the organization’s objectives. For instance, some of the projects include *Youth against poverty workshop, SCOT Agriculture, SCOT education* and one of their major projects yet was the Green Xchange project. For instance, the project aims to teach the public the advantage of trading between recyclable materials and basic necessities such as rice.

The next case study was on Brutel company. Briefly, Brutel is a telecommunication company and was first build in 2014. The company also has the initiatives to merge Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in their organization aligned with Brunei’s Wawasan 2035. For instance, one of the focus area that Brutel looking forward to was to conserve Brunei’s natural environment. Thus, one of the ‘green’ approaches that was initiated by Brutel was to “gopaperless”. According to Odell (2008), it is expected that electronic bill would lead to decrease the use of papers to save the trees to produce papers and save costs on printing.

The last case study was on Sumbiling Eco village. Sumbiling eco village was founded by Leslie Chiang and the company was located in Temburong district. Furthermore, It was a social enterprise company that was concerned with preserving the environment while contributing to the economy. Other than that, the company also aimed to protect the culture and the locals' knowledge. In preserving the environment, there have been many initiatives done by the company such as lesser use of electricity , practice the use of 3R (Reduce , Reuse, Recycle) , setting the rules to not cut trees more than 6 inches , build hand-made benches and chairs for visitors with the use of bamboos and woods instead of using modern materials etc.

## 1.2 Objectives

It can be observed that the initiatives that each organization intends to do are not without any challenges. For instance, in the case studies several issues were mentioned with regards to the projects that they initiated and the strategy that they have used to overcome the issue. Therefore, this paper attempts to ;

* Identify ODC strategies that has was stated in the three case study;
* To suggest additional recommendations to the above strategies

# 2.0 Problem Statement

This section will give the overview of arising issues from the three case studies;

**Social Community Outreach Training (SCOT)’s Green Xchange project**

One of the frequent challenges faced by NGOs globally was the challenge in sustaining their funds in order for them to survive in the long term (Lewis & Kanji ,2009; Rehema, 2014; Musa & Idris, 2019). For instance, SCOT also encountered the same issue. According to Musa & Idris (2019), funding is a necessity for Brunei NGOs to carry out project based activities such as outreach programs and training. The author further added that difficulties in obtaining funds would affect the smooth implementation of the projects. Moreover, it was mentioned in the case study that the presence of the problems was due to the misconception that NGOs do their work voluntarily and does not require funding (Musa & Idris, 2019). Thus, Anwar Muhammad planning out several strategies to get the company self-sustain.

It was stated in the case that Green Xchange projects that have been initiated would help the organization to not depend on other parties in order to get funded. Consequently, there were also challenges encountered with the project. Some of the challenges being stated were regarding the inconsistent prices of food, potential lowered recycling rates and lack of manpower if the projects were to be carried out on a larger scale.

**BruTel**

The issue that the BruTel had to face when trying to implement their ‘Gopaperless’ approach was the difficulties from the elderly customers who are not techno-savvy and were resistant to transition from traditional paper-based to online-based. For instance, according to Idris & Ismail (2019), the elderly encounter difficulties in using the technology without any guidance or support. Moreover, Kazimi (2014) argued that due to complexities of using technology , senior citizens were hesitant to use such platforms (Idris & Ismail, 2019). Other than that, it was also mentioned in the case that the elderly refuse to use e-bill because the paper bills help to remind them to pay their bills and due to customer’s oftenly forgetting their password.

**Sumbiling eco village**

There were a lot of different issues being faced by the company. One of the issues was the challenge in maintaining the objects such as benches or chairs that were made up of raw materials. For instance, it was mentioned in the case that the materials wear away easily which caused the owner to mix it with modern materials. Moreover, hiring and recruiting expertise in the field of ecotourism in Brunei to enhance their product and services (Idris, Gadong, Morni & Wahab, 2019). Furthermore, challenges in terms of getting competition from other countries such as Miri and Sarawak that could possibly offer better services and are more appealing to tourists. Also, the challenge in getting electricity and water supply. Other than that, Leslie Chiang also finds it hard to change the mind-sets with regards to ecotourism to the public.

**3.0 Case Analysis**

**SCOT’s Green Xchange projects**

One of the major issues faced by SCOT was in terms of funding. According to C. Batti 2014), NGOs have been depending on donors to support their projects or activities for a long time. Consequently, the organization did realize that such sources of funding were often inadequate for the organization to carry out projects in the long term C. Batti 2014. The author further added that local NGOs find it a challenge to sustain enough funding as the projects need a considerable amount of resources. Thus, there’s a need for “resource mobilization” in the organization as per mentioned in the case study to gain

Other than that, according to Kharanth, (2015) it is crucial for NGOs to exploit the resources that they have in hand as there were limited opportunities in increasing the funds and dependency on donors and sponsors became vital. The author also stated that for NGOs to be able to sustain in the rapidly changing and competitive environment, it is necessary for the organization to exploit the financial management tools. Good financial management allows the NGOs to receive respect and confidence from related parties such as partners, donors as well as other stakeholders. In addition, it will also help NGOs to themselves financially prepared and sustain in a long terms (Lewis , 2009 ; Kharanth, 2015)

**BruTel**

The main issue concerning BruTel was the elderly resistance to use the ‘e-bill’ online payment platform. According to Cummings & Worley, 2009 change can lead to increase in people and the organization resistance in which making it hard implement strategic improvements for the organization. In terms of individuals , change can lead to anxiety due to the uncertainty about the future.

There were several factors that associate with oppose to change such as fear of the unknown or the new changes, unaware of the benefits and consequences of the changes etc. (Gonçalves & Gonçalves, 2012). For instance, according to Gonçalves & Gonçalves, 2012 advancements in technologies have always been the target that related to risk. For instance, there exists concern with regards to new information, new ways of working and thinking that require change in the role of humans in all aspects.

**Sumbiling Eco Village (SEV)**

There were principles that underlies theories with ecotourism , Wight (cited in Gunn, 1994; Dimitriou, 2017) list the following principles:

1. It should provide education to all parties such as the local communities, government, non-government organisations, industry and tourists
2. It should incorporate all party recognition of core values related to the intrinsic values of the resource.
3. It should recognize its own capabilities and limits
4. It should involve partnerships between many players. This may involve the government, non-governmental organisations etc

# 4.0 Literature review

This category will provide the strategies that have been carried out by each of the organizations in dealing with their respective issues.

**SCOT**

Some of the ODC strategies that have been introduced to manage issues faced by SCOT such as funding issues were to offer training and workshops. For instance, one of SCOT’s projects to alleviate poverty was the “Youth against poverty workshop” and at the same time it was able to raise funds by charging fees to those who participate in the workshop. Moreover, Anwar Muhammad also had mentioned that the establishment of Green Xchange projects was hoped to help the organization to self-sustain. For instance, from the Green Xchange programs, SCOT is able to exchange BND1 for 1 kg of recyclables collected.

In terms of solving the issue during the implementation of the Green Xchange project, to overcome the price volatility, the organization considered partnership with food retailers and farms. Thus, make it easier for them to buy the basic necessities for the exchange. Moreover, to overcome the issues with lack of manpower, SCOT uses the power of social media to recruit their volunteers such as through television, radio as well as adverts.

**BruTel**

There were no specific OCD strategies being implemented to manage the issue that had arisen. Despite the rise in issues, BruTel were adopting the online platform for customers to be able to pay their bills online through the new application; BruTel E-wallet.

BruTel were still needed to figure out ways on how to attract the elderly user to use the “e-bill” and the need to promote their CSR campaign.

**Sumbiling eco village**

Sumbiling Eco Village has succeeded in spreading awareness and nurturing sustainability of the environment in Temburong District. For instance, the company was able to advertise its ecotourism on various different platforms such as travel guide website “Lonely planet”, “Trip advisor” which offer previews of travel-related insights. Other than that, social media also plays a huge part in promoting ecotourism. For instance, the company receives help from bloggers and young individuals who use social media to promote Sumbiling Eco Village. Other social media platforms also include promoting the SEV via facebook where a group of young individuals (Sutera) has conducted interviews and created a documentary on SEV and posted it on social media. Moreover, SEV has also successfully attracted international attention such as the “Law of jungle” which is one of the famous Korean Reality TV shows.

To sustain the eco village environment, the employees were all trained and reminded to protect the environment by becoming more environmentally conscious

# 5.0 Alternatives solutions

# This section will list out a few suggested solutions for each of the organizations to overcome with the arising issues.

# SCOT

* Resource mobilization

Look for sources externally and internally. However, some of the consequences encountered will be in terms of competitiveness from other NGOs that also seeks for funding,

* Funding management

# Bringing in financial expertise in the organization in order to manage budgeting of the company. In which the role of financial expertise were ro manage the organization’s financial resources, do budgeting for the organization as well as financial reporting, establishing financial policies and many more.

# BruTel

To overcome problems related to resistance from the customers , the organization may be provide guidance for the elderly customers

For instance, it is important for the managers to put themselves in the shoes of the customer. Managers should educate the elderly customers in terms of what their innovation is about, informing them with the changing trends and globalization. Furthermore, provide more info on the needs to change into an online platform. This would overcome the customers “fears of the unknown” as they were provided with all the info and guidance.

**Sumbiling eco village**

One of the major issues was regarding the lack of experts. Thus, solutions to overcome this challenges was to:

* Establishing network with international or local NGOs that were also preserving the environment
